Project for testing purposes

XXXTo dev work after cloning the repo use `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build` for the initial setup and fixing temporary errors, after executing this command you can just start coding (the changes will be applied after each save).localhost:80 or localhost:3000
XXXIn order to debug code in VSC make sure that you have [.vscode/launch.json](https://github.com/JakubSzuber/test-project/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json) from that project. Note that the initial start and first compiling can take a little more time than usual, automatic reload of the website's content. If you encounter any problems with dev work try to restart the container, your whole Docker and eventually WSL2.
